# Notebook

The program represents the sumple version of Notebook. The realisation is made, using classes and differents methods. I use three classes: `Note()`, `Notebook()` and `Menu()`. The user may enjoy this realisation with a few methods that helps to use that as a real notebook.

There are these methods:
- `display_menu()`
- `run()`
- `show_notes()`
- `search_note()`
- `add_note()`
- `modify_note()`
